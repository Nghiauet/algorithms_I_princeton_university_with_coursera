## Answer for question 1

My solution is
stack_1 for dequeue only stack_2 for enqueue only.
def enqueue(x)
stack_1.push (x)
def dequeue(x)
if stack_2 is empty:
if stack_1 is empty: failback
while stack_1 not empty
stack_2 = stack_1.pop
stack 2.pop
if stack_2 not empty => stack_2 pop

## Answer for question 2


Create 2 stack first for push and pop and stack 2 for save max operation till the head
def pop:
pop stack 1
stack2 and stack1 decrease head by 1
def push
push to stack 1
push to stack 1
if value > stack2.head
head = head+ 1
stack2.head = value
else head = head + 1
stack2.head =stack2.[head -1]
