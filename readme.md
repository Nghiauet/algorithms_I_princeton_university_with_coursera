# Course Algorithms Part 1: Code Practice

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments for the course "Algorithms, Part 1" offered by Princeton University on Coursera. The course is part of the "Data Structures and Algorithms" specialization.

## Course Information

- Course Name: Algorithms, Part 1
- Instructor: Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne
- Platform: Coursera
- Specialization: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `week1/`: Contains the Python code for the first week's programming assignment.
- `week2/`: Contains the Python code for the second week's programming assignment.
- ...
- `weekN/`: Contains the Python code for the Nth week's programming assignment.

## How to Use

Each week's code is organized in its respective directory. To run the code, navigate to the directory and run the Python file.

For example, to run the code for the first week's assignment, navigate to the `week1/` directory and run the `main.py` file.

```bash
cd week1
python main.py
